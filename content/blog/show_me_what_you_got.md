## Test Manager Nightmare
Have you ever met your project manager in the kitchen, with a rough look, who asked you about the Test Status?

Did you see **"Get Schwifty"** episode of Rick and Morty cartoon? Big Head come and ask to show something you donâ€™t know what and if you lose the planet will be destroyed. I am head of QA in our company and I always get stuck then Big Boss find me not on my workplace, ask about progresses and his look said, what live on our planet depends on it. And you can not say exact numbers. Did something similar happen to you?
We solved this problem for you! With MoQA you can check the real progress everywhere! :)
